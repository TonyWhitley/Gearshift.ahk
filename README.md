# Gearshift.ahk
AutoHotkey script that monitors a shifter and clutch and if a gear change is not done properly it repeatedly sends a "Neutral" key press to prevent the gear being selected. Designed for rFactor 2 but should work with any game.

Install https://autohotkey.com/ then double click on Gearshift.ahk (Grind_default.wav  needs to be in the same folder) before loading rF2. In rF2 map Numpad 0 as "Neutral".
